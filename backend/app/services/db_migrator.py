# backend/app/services/db_migrator.py
#
# Startup migration runner.
# On every app start it:
#   1. Creates schema_migrations table if it doesn't exist (safety net for
#      databases created before migration tracking was added).
#   2. If schema_migrations is empty and the `projects` table already exists,
#      marks 000_baseline as applied (existing DB from before tracking).
#   3. Reads backend/migrations/delta/NNN_*.sql files in order and applies any
#      that haven't been recorded yet, then records them.
#
# Fresh DB flow:  docker-entrypoint-initdb.d runs init_db.sql which creates
#   schema_migrations and inserts 000_baseline.  Runner finds nothing to apply.
#
# Existing DB flow (no -v wipe):  schema_migrations already exists (or is
#   created here); runner applies only new delta files.
#
# Adding a schema change:
#   Create backend/migrations/delta/NNN_description.sql with idempotent SQL,
#   e.g. "ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS bar TEXT DEFAULT '';"
#   It will be applied automatically on the next app restart.
